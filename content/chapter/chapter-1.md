## Classes

Ideas for a replacement of the class system:

- at level 1, you choose a "Archetype" (Warrior, Adept, Expert)
- at level 3(2?), you choose an "Advanced Path"
- at level 7, you choose a "Master Path"
- the maximum level is 10
- for epic campaigns, you can make another Archetype-Advanced-Master chain starting from level 11 up to level 20

This allows for similar "builds" with a different focus. For example, you can create a Warrior-Paladin-Champion (more combat-oriented) or an Adept-Paladin-Chaplain (more priestly and religious).

## Magic
Magic is restricted and dangerous: you only know a few spells, and magic requires "energy". This "energy" has to be absorbed by the caster, who in turn can use it to fuel spells. The energy is sucked from the world around you, and to cast spells, you first need to generate energy. When you learn magic, you will also get a "Geas" - this determines where you can draw energy from.
