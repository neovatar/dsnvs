## Magic
- Magic is restricted and dangerous
- only adept archetypes can use magic
- you only know a few spells, and magic requires "energy"
- This "energy" has to be absorbed by the caster, who in turn can use it to fuel spells.
- The energy is sucked from the world around you, and to cast spells, you first need to generate energy
- When you learn magic, you will also get a "Geas" - this determines where you can draw energy from.
