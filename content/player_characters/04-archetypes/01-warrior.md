## Level 1: Warrior Features

### Proficiencies

- **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, heavy armor, shields

- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons

- **Tools:** None

- **Saving Throws:** Strength, Choose one from Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma

- **Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival

### Fighting Style

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-­handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Polearm Fighting
When wielding a reach weapon, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on a melee attack roll within your reach.

#### Shield Fighting
If you make a successful melee attack roll you can use your bonus action to slam the target with your shield. The target must be no more than one size larger than you. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) check. You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.

#### Two-­Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-­weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Unarmed Fighting
You can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed Strikes. You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike.

### Battle Hardened
You are trained in the ways of surviving the fray. Choose either Second Wind or Unarmored Defense.

#### Second Wind
You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your warrior level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

#### Unarmored Defense
Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your the Attribute modifier from your second chosen saving throw proficiency (Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma).

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, and 10th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1.
