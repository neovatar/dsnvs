title: "Archetypes"
draft: false

The standard 5e system of classes and subclasses is replaced by a combination of archetype, advanced path, and master path:

- at level 1, you choose a "Archetype" (Warrior, Scoundrel, Expert, or Adept)
- at level 3, you choose an "Advanced Path"
- at level 7, you choose a "Master Path"
- the maximum level is 10
- for epic campaigns, you can make another Archetype-Advanced-Master chain starting from level 11 up to level 20

This allows for similar "character builds" with a different focus. For example, you can create a Warrior-Paladin-Champion or an Expert-Paladin-Champion. The first would be more focused on combat, while the second would follow a more scholarly approach, while still bringing some brawn to the field.
