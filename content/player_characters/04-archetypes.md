title: "Archetypes"
draft: false
---

The standard 5e system of classes and subclasses is replaced by a combination of archetype, advanced path, and master path:

- at level 1, you choose a "Archetype" (Warrior, Scoundrel, Expert, or Adept)
- at level 3, you choose an "Advanced Path"
- at level 7, you choose a "Master Path"
- the maximum level of an Archetype is 10
- for epic campaigns, you can make another Archetype-Advanced-Master chain starting from level 11 up to level 20

This allows for similar "character builds" with a will different focus. For example, you can create a Warrior-Paladin-Champion or an Expert-Paladin-Champion. The first would be more focused on combat, while the second would follow a more scholarly approach, while still bringing some brawn to the field.

## Design principles

### Types of Feats

- general feats, unlimited uses
- maneuvers fueled by maneuver points (mp) jgsfjghsdf
  - maneuver points are a common resource, different feats from archetypes and paths all use the same maneuver point pool
- powerful abilities (x per long rest)
- to use the feats one should have to spend action, bonus action, or reaction. You should have to decide on what you want to spend your different action resources
